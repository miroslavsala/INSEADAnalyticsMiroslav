# You are selling stuffed toy animals for holiday season. 
# Each animal first is sold in a test market, and the "test" data is recorded. 
# Then the selected toys are sold in all markets, and the total "sales" data is recorded. 
# In addition, the kind of the toy is recorded, "SKU". 
# The goal is to predict the market sales of a "Bear" for which the test sales = 10 items.

# I. Input the data.
# 1. Read the "T1 Sales Data.csv" into test.sales.data dataframe


# II. Explore the data
# 1. Examine data types, check if these are detected correctly.
# 2. Summarize the dataset.
# 3. Plot the total market sales against test sales
# 4. Plot the log-linear relation


# III. Single regression
# 1. Regress Sales on Test.
# 2. Look at the regression summary.
# 3. Plot the trendline.
# 4. Plot the diagnostics.
# 5. Create a dataframe for prediction.
# 6. Predict the Sales values.


# IV. Multiple regression
# 1. Regress Sales on Test and SKU.
# 2. Look at the summary.
# 3. Plot the diagnostics.
# 4. Create a dataframe for prediction.
# 5. Predict the Sales values
